   * ## [A Unified Representation and a Decoupled Deep Learning Architecture for Argumentation Mining of Students' Persuasive Essays (AM_2022_coling2022)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.argmining-1.6/)
   
        We develop a novel unified representation for the argumentation mining task facilitating the extracting from text and the labelling of the non-argumentative units and argumentation components---premises, claims, and major claims---and the argumentative relations---premise to claim or premise in a support or attack relation, and claim to major-claim in a for or against relation---in an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. This tightly integrated representation combines the component and relation identification sub-problems and enables a unitary solution for detecting argumentation structures. This new representation together with a new deep learning architecture composed of a mixed embedding method, a multi-head attention layer, two biLSTM layers, and a final linear layer obtain state-of-the-art accuracy on the Persuasive Essays dataset. Also, we have introduced a decoupled solution to identify the entities and relations first, and on top of that a second model is used to detect distance between the detected related components. An augmentation of the corpus (paragraph version) by including copies of major claims has further increased the performance.

* Notes:

    * New augmented corpus are available in the datasets folder.

    * Decoupled_AM model will be available soon.

* To reproduce the results from the papers:
    
    1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/tawsifsazid/Unified-Representation-for-Argumentation-Mining.git`
    
    2. Create an environment (Python 3.9.7) and run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
    3. Install PyTorch: `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia` or from the [official website]!(https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
    
    4. The weight files can be downloaded from the links. Folder name 'weight' should contain the downloaded files before running the code.
